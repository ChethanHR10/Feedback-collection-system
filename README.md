# Feedback Collection System

This project is a **Feedback Collection System** designed to gather and store user feedback using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB (Atlas)**. The system provides a simple interface for users to submit feedback and securely stores the data in the cloud using **Mongoose** for schema management. After successfully submitting their feedback, users are redirected to a "Thank You" page confirming receipt.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Feedback Form**: Users can submit their name, email, feedback message, and a rating.
- **Data Storage**: Feedback is stored securely in a MongoDB Atlas database using Mongoose for data validation and schema management.
- **Redirection and Confirmation**: After submitting the form, users are redirected to a custom "Thank You" page, providing feedback confirmation.
- **RESTful API**: The system provides routes for both submitting feedback and retrieving stored feedback data.
- **Responsive Design**: The front-end design adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for handling HTTP requests and defining routes.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, connected via Mongoose for schema definitions and data validation.
- **Frontend**: HTML and CSS for form layout and styling. Optional use of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap for additional styling.
- **Environment Configuration**: dotenv is used to manage environment variables such as the MongoDB connection string.

## Project Structure

- **Views Folder**: Contains the HTML files for the feedback form and the thank you page.
- **Models Folder**: Contains the Mongoose schema for defining and validating the feedback data stored in MongoDB.
- **Server File**: The main server logic, routes, and MongoDB connection logic are defined here.

## How It Works

1. **Homepage (Feedback Form)**: The user accesses the feedback form, enters their details, and submits the feedback.
2. **Data Submission**: Once submitted, the form data is sent to the server, validated, and stored in MongoDB.
3. **Confirmation**: After a successful submission, the user is redirected to a "Thank You" page confirming their feedback was received.
4. **Viewing Feedback**: Administrators or developers can access the submitted feedback by using a GET request to retrieve the stored data from MongoDB.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files from the repository.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm to install required dependencies such as Express, Mongoose, and dotenv.
3. **Environment Setup**: Create a `.env` file with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
4. **Run the Server**: Start the server, and the project will be accessible via `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Admin Authentication**: Implement an admin panel to view, edit, and delete feedback.
- **Pagination and Search**: Add features to paginate and search through feedback entries.
- **Email Notifications**: Send confirmation emails to users upon submitting feedback.
- **Enhanced Validation**: Improve form validation on both client and server sides for better data integrity.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple yet robust solution for collecting user feedback. It demonstrates how to build a full-stack feedback system that securely stores data, offering an intuitive user experience and a reliable backend for data handling.
